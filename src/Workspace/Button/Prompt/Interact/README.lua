INSTRUCTIONS:
- Don't touch or edit "Visual". It's just to make the button polished.
- To add function, edit "Function". It is recommended that you have SOME scripting
	knowledge to edit this. "Function" is already set up for you, just add the function.
- This model stays in workspace
- In this base model, a button sound noise plays and the button goes down for half
	a second before coming back up.

WHAT CAN I EDIT?
- "Interact"
- "Function"
- "button press " (AUDIO)
- Any physical part in this model
